This is our Project 3 for COP3530.
It's a prefix-searching dictionary for Japanese learners. 
It implements a trie and B+ tree and utilizes the simple timer application provided in Programming 2.

Starting the program:
Navigate to the project directory via your terminal.
If using Linux, link everything with "make".
On Windows, run the following command (which can also be found in the Makefile): 
g++ -Wall ./src/main.cpp ./src/Trie.cpp ./src/BPlusTree.cpp ./src/Menu.cpp ./src/SimpleTimer.cpp -o RomajiBridge

Housekeeping:
All dependencies should be put inside the src folder and regularly pushed to the main branch on Github.
